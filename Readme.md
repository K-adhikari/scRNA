This repository consists of codes I wrote while I was learning to analyze single cell RNA-seq data. The data used here came from [Caron et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64929-x#Sec7) and were deposited in GEO under GSE132509. I specifically used three datasets: GSM3872442 (PBMMC_1), GSM3872443 (PBMMC_2), and GSM3872444 (PBMMC_3). All three samples came from healthy pediatric bone marrow mononuclear cells. For analysis, I took help from tutorials provided by "Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics" on Single cell transcriptomics. Data was analyzed using 'Seurat' in R.
